# PoC RNN Polymer Dynamics
Matt Hagy, matthew.hagy@gmail.com

Initial proof-of-concept studying machine learning
[RNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)
using concepts from [polymer dynamics theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer_physics).

See the notebook `poc_rnn_polymer.ipynb` for this initial work.

TODO: Document how other people can reproduce this work using [keras-attention](https://github.com/datalogue/keras-attention)
and the scripts in the `scripts` directory.

Feel free to submit a PR if you have any ideas to improve or extend this work.
